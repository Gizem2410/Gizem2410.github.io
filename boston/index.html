                        <p>As the scramble for scarce vaccines intensifies, a band of volunteers has stepped in to accomplish the task that has defeated so many: making an appointment to get a COVID-19 shot.

                            Massachusetts COVID Vaccination Help, as this posse of mostly young women is called, launched on Feb. 20, and claims to have landed appointments for 450 people as of Monday, through a combination of technological know-how and persistence. And they did it all for free.

                        <p>In the brilliant and hugely successful Netflix miniseries “The Queen’s Gambit,” the chess prodigy Beth Harmon (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) polishes off her male opponents with style and speed. A big winner at Sunday night’s Golden Globe awards, the series is set in the 1950s and 1960s, where there are no cell phones, social media, or computer chess programs. Life was slower then, as it again seems to be nowadays during the pandemic.

                        <p>Not long after her 80th birthday last March, Patricia DeGeorge, feeling a bit old and depressed, tried to cheer herself up by window shopping at the Northshore Mall in Peabody.

                            As the Everett woman walked along, a young man stepped in front of her, flashed a big smile, and offered a free sample of skin cream. He said it would help erase her wrinkles.

                            Minutes later, DeGeorge said, she found herself being fussed over inside the Forever Flawless cosmetics store.</p>
